# ImageProcessing

Contains multiple examples on how images can be processed using C# .NET.

## Recognize Numbers by Signature

In the first example we will identify numbers (0-9) in an image by using 
their signature.

These are the images with the numbers in their unprocessed from.

 1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
![1](./doc/1-number-by-signature/1.jpg) | ![2](./doc/1-number-by-signature/2.jpg) | ![3](./doc/1-number-by-signature/3.jpg) | ![4](./doc/1-number-by-signature/4.jpg) | ![5](./doc/1-number-by-signature/5.jpg)

 6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  0
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
![6](./doc/1-number-by-signature/6.jpg) | ![7](./doc/1-number-by-signature/7.jpg) | ![8](./doc/1-number-by-signature/8.jpg) | ![9](./doc/1-number-by-signature/9.jpg) | ![0](./doc/1-number-by-signature/0.jpg)


After applying different processing steps this is the result so far.
